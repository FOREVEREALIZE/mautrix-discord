# unreleased

* Started automatically subscribing to bridged guilds. This fixes two problems:
  * Typing notifications should now work automatically in guilds.
  * Huge guilds now actually get messages bridged.
* Improved markdown parsing to disable more features that don't exist on Discord.
* Removed width from inline images (e.g. in the `guilds status` output) to
  handle non-square images properly.
